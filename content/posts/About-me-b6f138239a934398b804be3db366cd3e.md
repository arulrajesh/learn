I'm Arul Rajesh, based out of Hyderabad. I'm deeply entrenched in the world of FPV drone racing. As the co-founder of FPV India, my goal is clear: to transform drone racing into a recognized and accessible sport nationwide. Drawing on insights from global drone racing clubs in Singapore, Russia, Australia, and Hungary, I've established the MultiGP chapter in India, implementing best practices for our community.


Professionally, I run the Data Science and AI initiatives of a financial services company, Mogo based out of Canada.


My expertise extends beyond piloting—I specialize in designing tracks, creating the automated timing system, and developing race management software, all of which have streamlined drone racing events across the country. Introducing marathon drone racing format and establishing India's sole FPV practice track in Hyderabad are among my proudest achievements.


Through my professional approach and dedication, I'm committed to driving the growth and professionalism of drone racing in India.



Events I've participated and/or Curated in collaboration with Nilesh Jivani from Anubisrc.com
