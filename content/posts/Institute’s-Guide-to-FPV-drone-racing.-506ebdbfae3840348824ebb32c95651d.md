Handbook of FPV Drone racing


The purpose of this handbook is to outline the expectations for the institute hosting the event and the support provided by MultiGP and AnubisRC for  a successful FPV drone race. 


> 💡 The goal is to create an entertaining experience for the audience while also ensuring a fulfilling race for the participating pilots.


## 1.The Ground


![](https://notion-hugo.pages.dev/api?block_id=ec178ef6-4013-45d0-8a99-cea74bd08810)

- The ground should be a cricket or football ground, preferably with grass. Please check the ground blueprint to ensure that there are no pipes running under the ground within the top 1 foot layer. 20 mm rebar will be hammered into the ground as the foundation for the gate. The holes are the size of spiked lawn aerators. Read more about lawn aerators [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawn_aerator). Please make sure you have proper permission from management.

- The holes are a bout 1 foot deep and roughly the size of your finger. There is no damage to the turf in doing this.




![A graphic showing some of the MultiGP obstacles.](https://www.multigp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mgp-course-obstacles-all-e1531849966906.jpg)

- The obstacles for the drone race will consist of [standard multigp gates.](https://www.multigp.com/multigp-drone-race-course-obstacles/) All the necessary hardware for building these gates will be provided by AnubisRC. Institute volunteers will assemble the gates under the guidance of NJ and Arul. These gates are preferred because they are forgiving and visually appealing. While you have the freedom to create additional obstacles, please refer to our track design philosophy as shown in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdHK7y04Sb8). The minimum opening size for the gates should be 5x5 feet square.

![The BITS hyderabad track, with LED ground lighting and Gate lighting. Ground lighting is desirable. Ntice how the LEDs are incorrectly installed on the inside border. That is the allwance where pilots will crash and will lead to frequent track repairs. LEDs should always be installed along the outer edge of the Gate.](https://notion-hugo.pages.dev/api?block_id=a98f9358-1706-4f3b-9d47-f3751a68370a)

- If the event is a night race, floodlights are mandatory. Optionally, LEDs can be installed to enhance the track's appearance. The Institute will handle the procurement of the LEDs. The race gates are designed to accommodate LED installation. The LEDs can be compared to shining a bright flashlight in your face in the FPV world, so they should be installed in a way that the bright side faces away from the direction the pilot enters the gate. Pink and NJ (hereafter referred to as the Wise ones) will provide guidance on the installation process. To complete the installation, you will need a packet of [zip ties](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B0B6FPGW58). (Yes, I have these, but we never have enough.)

## 2.The Pit Area


![Shady, Ion, Twilight, Mr Gold,  and  Droneflipper in the Pit Area, You can also notice the race director’s tent the Right side. This PIT Area is sufficient for about 8 pilots.](https://notion-hugo.pages.dev/api?block_id=7ac8e8c7-c2f7-4c2d-ab94-ae7733860a30)

1. The above image provides an example of a decent PIT Area for 8 Pilots. It showcases the inclusion of fans, which are crucial for maintaining a comfortable environment for the participants. Additionally, the power sockets are conveniently placed towards the back of each table row in the tent, ensuring easy access and a clutter-free workspace for the pilots.
1. If the size of the tables is taken into account here then, 2 tables and 1 chair are needed per Pilot.
1. A better way to place tables, than in the above image, would be to merge two rows of tables into a single row, creating more space and reducing congestion.
1. Lighting inside the PIT Area should be installed in case of a night race. The lights should be installed in the front, facing inwards. However, in the above image, they forgot to install any lights, so we had to repurpose some leftover LEDs. If you choose to go down that route, make sure the LEDs installed in the Pit area are orange, like in the image above. Blue, green, and red LEDs give me a headache.
1. You can use this [signage ](https://unsplash.com/photos/OY4fDz1hwps)for the PIT Area.

	![PIT area printable sign](https://notion-hugo.pages.dev/api?block_id=7d35dfe5-41d6-464e-b7a3-dff01a031794)

1. Make sure to provide an ample supply of RO water for the pilots during the FPV drone race. It's important to remember that pilots can easily get lost in the excitement of the event and forget to hydrate. By offering them enough water, you can help ensure their well-being and performance throughout the race. So, be proactive and keep those water bottles filled and readily available for the pilots to grab whenever they need a refreshing drink. Trust me, they'll appreciate it!

# 3.The Race Director’s Tent

# 4.The Volunteers


![NJ, Iam_DC and the Volunteers assembling the Dive Gate. Also, a classic example of what not to be doing, as being portrayed here by the volunteer in the Left glued to his eye-magnet.](https://notion-hugo.pages.dev/api?block_id=31394f32-062f-4cc1-a8b6-d1521bfc8567)


The Teams:

1. Track team:(the more the merrier, minimum 8 volunteers)
	1. Assemble the track.
	1. Repair the track during breaks.
	1. Install LED lighting.
1. The safety team(10 volunteers)
	1. Cordon off the track, stop unsuspecting jaywalkers who wander onto the track. You can tie a Rope around the entire track and stick [this](https://unsplash.com/photos/2EAp8tS8uwU) ↓ around the track.

		![](https://notion-hugo.pages.dev/api?block_id=80f8f283-6498-41cf-8393-cc9d4a39ccc0)

1. The Engagement tent (2 volunteers)
	1. Manage the engagement tent
1. The Guest coordinators(1 volunteer per Out-Of-Station pilot)
	1. From the moment the pilots arrive at the main gate, provide them with a warm welcome and assist them with various campus formalities. This includes helping them with any necessary paperwork, registration, and other administrative tasks. Additionally, if accommodation is provided for the pilots, ensure that they are guided to their designated rooms and assist them with any questions or concerns they may have.
	1. Offer travel assistance to the pilots. This can involve providing information about transportation options, helping them arrange transportation to and from the event venue, and addressing any travel-related queries they may have.
	By prioritizing the pilots' needs upon their arrival, we can ensure a smooth and hassle-free experience for them, setting the stage for a successful FPV drone race.
1. The Recovery Crew- 4 volunteers

           Recover crashed quads, you'll need walkies to coordinate amongst yourselves.


# 5.The LED Screen


![The LED screen at IIT Gandhinagar Race, a must have for audience engagement.](https://notion-hugo.pages.dev/api?block_id=7e14a0c1-3b93-4e80-83f2-57ec095f74d2)

1. A 10 x 20 ft screen with 1080P resolution, to show the live Video feed to the Audience. Institute to arrange this for the event.
1. Prefer a single larger screen to two screens as the lap times visible only on higer resolution screens. 480p is too low resolution.

# 6.The Timelines and Track/ Arena/ circuit.. …we call it the track

1. The event typically takes place over a weekend to ensure maximum participation. Saturday is designated as the practice day, while Sunday is reserved for the actual race.
1. On Practice Day, pilots are organized into groups of three. Racing start by 7 AM on Practice day and goes late into the night upto 11 pm. The idea is to get the pilots to familiarize them selves with track, which allows them to fly safer and faster, leading to a more enjoyable experience for the audience. They are allocated 20-minute slots throughout the day and night, granting them exclusive access to the race track. Each pilot takes turns flying the track continuously until they've exhausted all their LiPo batteries, while the other two serve as pit crew for the active pilot. Once all three pilots have completed their practice session, the next set of pilots will take to the track. During this time, pilots can recharge their battery packs and interact with the audience at the FPV Experience Center.
1. The Wise Ones will arrive on the Friday preceding the practice day. This day starts early, and we should have access to power and the PIT Area. The track must be fully prepared and ready by the end of Friday. All the materials required for track assembly will be delivered no later than Thursday night or, at the latest, by Friday morning.
1. Initially, the focus will be on assembling the track. Installing each gate should take approximately 10 minutes with the assistance of two volunteers. The installation of LEDs will be done as decided, but must be scheduled once the event is finalized. it takes about 3 hours for 12 gates if the electrician is available continuously and the misscelleanous materials such as the zip ties/ hairbands are available. You will need about 100 hair ties,  about 20 feet of LED per Gate and track length is about 1000 Feet for a standard 10 gate GQ track. ZIp ties will be required for installation of LEDs on the Gates. YOu will need about 400 nos. 30 mm zip ties. zip ties are usually available in packs of 100 at the harware store.
1. Ensuring power availability in the PIT Area is of utmost importance and must be in place by Friday morning, which is the day allocated for track setup.
1. By Saturday morning, the PIT Area should be fully prepared, complete with all the necessary tables, chairs, and fans. It is important to avoid using coolers or mist fans, as the moisture they generate can be detrimental to FPV electronics.
1. Some enthusiastic pilots may start arriving as early as Friday morning, so the guest coordinators should be ready to receive and assist them.

# 7.The FPV Experience center (Optional, But highly recommended)


![A typical simulator setup.](https://notion-hugo.pages.dev/api?block_id=eee12362-a341-496b-9d00-8ae20cac3fd4)

- A tent near the PIT Area with 3 Laptops/desktop with GPUs any rtx series or equivalent.
- AnubisRC will be providing controllers in different form factors, including Tx16s, Boxer, and Pocket. Students can try out the simulator and conveniently reserve a radio on the spot and have it shipped directly to their doorstep from [AnubisRC.com](http://anubisrc.com/) at a subsidized price.
- Before the practice day, we will conduct a 30-minute informational session for the students, introducing them to the thrilling world of FPV drone racing. Our goal is to provide insight into the sport that lets you experience the sensation of being in the cockpit of a fighter jet. By doing this, we aim to familiarize students with what unfolds on the screen and the race track, ultimately enhancing their engagement.

> 💡 The concept behind this tent is to offer aspiring FPV drone racing enthusiasts the opportunity to engage with experienced pilots and gain firsthand experience in the art of flying an FPV drone. The most effective way to begin your FPV journey is by starting with just a radio and a simulator. This approach can help you avoid the initial frustration and expenses associated with the first 200 crashes that often deter newcomers.


# 8.The Prize Money

- **Request the Institute to clear prize money in cheque form on the evening after Race day itself, or at the most within 10 days of event completion date.**

# 9. The Weekly Meeting:

- A weekly progress meeting for about an hour to discuss progress, challenges, event layout like track orientation landiang area, start line, pit area, screen placement, budget changes, prize pool distribution.

# 10. Safety

- This is a responsibility of everyone involved pilots, audience, organisers and volunteers.
- The PIT Area / Audience viewing area will be established in the designated location, carefully chosen based on the flight path of the FPV drones. I'm emphasizing this because, in previous instances, the tent provider installed the tent in the riskiest spot imaginable and then departed, necessitating a complete track alteration for safety considerations. The organizers have put significant effort into designing the track layout, ensuring that there is ample leeway for pilot error, particularly in challenging sections of the course, in order to keep both pilots and the audience safe.

# 11. Accomodation

1. Accomodation will be provided on Campus for all pilots attending, preferably on campus for the event.
1. Single occupancy rooms will be provided on campus at a cost not exceeding INR 500 per night.
1. In case accomodation is not provided on campus, a flat rate of 70,000 INR will be paid to AnubisRC. Anubis RC will then take care of Pilot accomodation and travel to and from the race venue for the duration of the event.
1. The pilots attending the event on invitation of MultiGP India are of the highest caliber in the country. Confirmation of arrangements to be made at least 1 week prior to the event.

## FAQs


### ♥ What it takes to be an FPV drone racing Pilot?


Becoming an FPV drone racing pilot demands a unique blend of skill, precision, and dedication. These pilots navigate crafts capable of reaching speeds close to 200 kmph, an experience often likened to trying to simultaneously ride three bicycles at maximum velocity. The intensity of concentration required during the mere three minutes of a race is staggering. Even the slightest movement of a finger can send the drones veering tens of meters off course.


Moreover, the equipment carried by each pilot is significantly expensive, frequently exceeding a value of 1 lakh INR. Every racing drone is meticulously assembled by the pilot themselves, who then fine-tune the open-source firmware, "Betaflight," to suit their preferences. These pilots push the limits of agility and speed, configuring their drones to achieve the highest possible performance.


On average, an elite pilot invests at least three years in rigorous practice sessions, continuously refining their skills by shaving off milliseconds and mastering optimal race lines. This journey demands unwavering commitment and persistence to excel in this thrilling and demanding sport.

We have the utmost respect for what these pilots are able to do, and its an honour to watch them fly. Pink Kaju out.

1. **Technical Inspections:** All drones must pass a pre-race technical inspection to ensure they meet safety standards and competition specifications. This includes checking for the proper functioning of the 'paralyze' feature, LED visibility, and adherence to the 25mW VTx power limit.
1. **No-Fly Zones:** Clearly demarcated 'No-Fly Zones' will be established around the racing area to protect spectators and non-participants. Entering a 'No-Fly Zone' during a race results in immediate disqualification of the offending team from the heat.
1. **Signal Interference:** Teams found intentionally interfering with another team's drone signals will be immediately disqualified from the competition. This includes both electronic signal jamming and physical obstruction.
1. **Environmental Respect:** Teams must ensure that their activities do not harm the race venue's environment. This includes properly disposing of any waste, such as damaged drone parts or used batteries, in designated areas. Teams violating environmental protection rules will face penalties or disqualification.
1. **Team Conduct:** All team members, including pilots, are expected to conduct themselves in a respectful and sportsmanlike manner. Unsportsmanlike conduct, such as verbal abuse, physical aggression, or cheating, will result in penalties or disqualification for the offending team.
1. **Equipment Modification:** No mid-heat modifications to drones are allowed, except for battery changes and repairs using tools and parts approved in the pre-race inspection. This ensures that all drones remain within competition specifications throughout the race.
1. **Start Procedure Compliance:** Teams must comply with the official start procedure, remaining in their designated pit area until the official race start is announced. Early takeoffs will result in a penalty.
1. **Post-Race Drone Retrieval:** Teams must retrieve their drones from the race area within a specified time after the completion of their heat. Delayed retrieval without a valid reason may result in a penalty.
1. **Battery Safety Standards:** All batteries used in the competition must meet specific safety standards to prevent fire risks. Teams must use batteries that are commercially manufactured for drone racing and have no visible damage or modifications.
1. **Fair Play Agreement:** All teams are required to sign a Fair Play Agreement before the competition, committing to the rules and spirit of the event. This includes a pledge to report any observed violations by other teams.

By implementing these additional rules, the competition aims to create a safe, fair, and enjoyable environment for all participants, while also respecting the venue and surroundin
